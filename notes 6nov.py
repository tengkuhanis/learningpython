#1 -> stack
#the first element pushed to the stack will be the last element will come out
#the last element pushed to the stack will be the first element will come out
#2 -> How it works?
# 3 5 7 19 21 33 45
#Node: data: 45, next: None
#stack: 45 -> 33 -> 19 -> 3 -> 5-> 21 -> 7 -> None - 33 is the top element previously, 45 new top
# top element is 45. we need to tell the stack that your new top element is the next element before any deletion
# the top element is now 33
#FILO
#our reference is the top element
#always check whether the stack is empty or not first thing first

#List: 7 -> 21 -> 5 -> 3 -> 19 -> 33 //-1 if (acting as stack)
#the list can act as a stack but it will never be a stack
#real life example: search history display on google search

#3-> queue
#4 -> How it works?
#whatever goes in first will go out first
#FIFO
#queue: 7 -> 21 -> 5 -> 3 -> 19 -> 33 -> None
#Head -> Front
#TAIL -> Rear
#the queue is empty if and only if the Front and Rear is None


#5 stack implementation using legal
#LL: we care about the head
#stack:we care about the top element

#8 Quiz #01


#example using stack
##History Page:

#instagram 5.15pm
#Facebook 5pm

#Node (website: , Time:  , Next)

#history_stack.push(Node(Facebook, 5pm, None))
#history_stack.push(Node(Instagram, 5.15pm, history_stack.top()))
#history_stack.top()=  Node(Instagram)
