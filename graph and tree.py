#GRAPH=====================================================
'''
-> 2 elements {vertices, edges} = {nodes, paths}
[5]-[10]
#relation;
1) indirected relation : you can go from a direction to another direction - u can go from 5 to 10 and from 10 to 5
----[5]<->[10]
2) directed relation : you can go from 5 to 10, but can never go from 10 to 5
----[5]->[10]


edge : hold some values -> weight
#if the graph hols some values - it is a weighted graph
A -- B -> 10 (amount of litres for petrol needed)

'''
#TREE==========================================================
'''
Tree : is a graph without cycle
#every single tree is a graph but it doesn't have a cycle
#Aevery single tree is a graph but not every graph is a tree
#tree will never have cycle
